What is the goal of treatment in glioblastoma?,"The goals are to manage your disease and keep you feeling as well as possible  for as long as possible. Unfortunately, there is no cure for glioblastoma. The treatments we have may help to shrink the tumor or slow it down to keep it from growing.  We also have a lot of hope for new treatments and many of these are in clinical trials. The brain tumor community is working tirelessly to advance new therapies. The goal of your care team is to manage the disease and keep it controlled for as long as possible. As important, the goals are to ensure that the side effects of treatment are minimized so you can have a good quality of life. Living your life to the fullest while getting treatment for glioblastoma is a critical concept.

Does surgery carry risks? Is surgery worth it?,"The risk of a particular operation is a discussion that you will have with your neurosurgeon. Estimating how much risk is involved with a surgery depends on your tumor location and your overall health, so it is a little different for each person.  In general, if your surgeon is recommending that you have surgery to have the tumor removed, they likely think that the risk of a serious complication is low.  If the risk of complications is high, the surgeon may suggest a biopsy (a less invasive procedure where only a small piece of the tumor is removed for diagnostic purposes) and not a bigger removal of the tumor. The goal of any brain tumor surgery is to remove as much tumor as possible without hurting you (also called a gross total resection). That said, all surgery including brain surgery has risks. Risks can include things like postoperative infection or bleeding in the brain, both of which could require additional surgery to treat. Also, with any brain surgery, there is a risk of strokes in the brain following the operation. These strokes may be asymptomatic or may cause permanent new neurologic problems. That all said, The risks of a serious complication with an experienced brain tumor surgery team are low. If the tumor can be removed, people tend to live longer and do better with the treatments that follow, so we usually think that the low risk of complications is worth the benefit.  ","neurosurgery, neurosurgeon, craniotomy, risks, complications, gross total resection",0.5,Treatment,NeuroSurgery Team,,,,
I’ve just had surgery for my brain tumor. I feel fluid swooshing around in my head. Is that normal?,"Patients can feel a variety of symptoms after brain tumor surgery. These include a sense of fluid moving around inside your head, ringing in your ears, pain when chewing, etc.  Certainly discuss these symptoms with your doctor if they occur. Concerning issues which should prompt urgent evaluation after surgery include fevers after surgery, drainage from the wound, and wound breakdown. Bottom line, if you’re concerned, talk to your doctor to get clarity.","brain surgery, craniotomy, postop, infection, wound, fluid",1,Treatment,"NeuroSurgery Team, Patient & Caregiver Team",,,,
Why do I need chemotherapy and radiation?,"For patients with glioblastoma and gliomas generally, surgery by itself is not an effective treatment without chemotherapy and radiation. This is because even though the tumor looks “gone” after surgery on the MRI scan, there will likely still be tumor cells mixed in with normal adjacent brain. In surgery, we typically cannot remove every last cell of tumor because that would likely cause permanent neurologic harm and disability to you.  You may hear patients with other types of cancer having surgery with “clean margins”, meaning that there was no cancer seen at the edges of what was removed. In neurosurgery, surgeons will never remove any more brain tissue than necessary. This is because the brain beyond the tumor is functionally important.  Because of this, it is always assumed that there are some tumor cells that get left behind. And so, our goals of chemotherapy and radiation are to kill those residual cells in the brain to prevent the tumor from re-growing.","chemotherapy, radiation, temodar, brain surgery, temozolomide",0.5,Treatment,"Neuro-Oncology Team, NeuroSurgery Team",,,,
Are there minimally invasive procedures or keyhole surgery options for glioblastoma?,"To remove a brain tumor, we need to temporarily remove a piece of skull to do the procedure. The incision length can vary depending on where the tumor is located and how big the tumor measures.  Your neurosurgeon's goal is to do an effective, safe procedure. That means taking out as much of the tumor as is possible while at the same time keeping you safe. So of course, ask about minimally invasive options, but the size of the incision is not that important. These incisions generally heal very well and quickly.

How does chemotherapy work?,"Cancer cells grow and divide quickly- chemotherapy drugs work to stop or slow the growth of these cancer cells by poisoning them. These treatments may damage healthy cells that are dividing quickly as well, causing possible side effects. However, these side effects usually improve after chemotherapy is stopped. There are lots of different types of chemotherapy. Some are used for multiple cancers, while a few are given only for select types. Chemotherapy can be taken in different ways such as with a pill or via an infusion into the blood. Many chemotherapies have unique dosing schedules which maximize their effectiveness and minimize side effects. The most commonly used chemotherapy used for glioblastoma is temozolomide (temodar), which is taken by mouth and gets into the brain well (across the blood brain barrier).

Are there special diets that I should consider either before or after surgery?,"There are no proven diets that are known to be effective with gliomas. However, there are many studies underway, including investigations in the ketogenic diet (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04691960) which may shed light on the effect of diets on patients with glioblastoma. In the meantime, please eat a healthy, nutritious diet and enjoy your food.","diet, ketogenic diet, nutrition",1,Treatment,Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,
What is temodar (ie temozolomide)? How does it work?,"Temozolomide is a chemotherapy medication. Most chemotherapy drugs, like temozolomide, work by killing rapidly dividing cells. Cancer cells are some of the most rapidly dividing cells in the body, and so temozolomide targets them. Temozolomide works by damaging the DNA of the cells so that the cell can no longer divide. Temozolomide is used for glioblastoma because it is a chemotherapy that can get into the brain.

How does radiation therapy work?,"In radiation treatment, X-rays are targeted at the tumor and/or the cavity where the tumor was taken out to kill the cancer cells. These X-rays are mapped to only target the area of the brain involved with the tumor and not the normal brain cells. You don’t feel the radiation treatment, and you aren’t “radioactive” (no one around you will be affected).","radiation, how things work",1,Treatment,Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,
Are there nutritional supplements I should take or avoid?,"Most of your nutritional needs should come from your food. The vast majority of people are able to get all of the vitamins and nutrients they need from a well-balanced diet.  Sometimes a multivitamin can be helpful if you have a more limited diet or a nutritional booster. 

Your doctor may recommend supplemental vitamins to treat specific health conditions.  For example, if you are anemic or have low iron, your doctor may recommend iron supplements, or if you have low bone density or are on long term steroids, your doctor may recommend calcium or vitamin D for bone health. 

To date, there has not been a nutritional supplement that is specifically proven to treat glioblastoma based on evidence from clinical trials. There is a lot of information out there that some supplements may help your body fight cancer or may boost your immune system. Some of these supplements can be quite safe, but others have potentially serious interactions with prescription medications.  

For example, there are some supplements that can increase the risk of bleeding, which is dangerous if you are on a blood thinner or if your blood counts are low from chemotherapy. Other supplements can interfere with the metabolism of chemotherapy pills or seizure medications, which can make the drug levels in your body higher or lower than what was intended for you. If you are considering a nutritional supplement, it is essential that you first discuss with your oncologist so they can check for any interactions with your other medications and keep you safe. ","diet, nutrition, supplements",1,Treatment,Neuro-Oncology Team,,checked,,
Do immune boosters work?,"The reality is that most marketed immune boosting products have no real solid, scientific basis behind them. If on blood work, you are found to be low on certain vitamin levels, then your doctor may recommend vitamin supplements. However, certain natural compounds like tumeric or natural drug combinations (like zinc + vitamin C) are marketed to patients but not necessarily based on sound scientific evidence. If you have a question about a natural drug remedy, you should ask your doctor about their opinion before taking these medications.","immune booster, immune, naturopathic, nutraceutical, homeopathic",2,Treatment,Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,

How do doctors make medical decisions?,"Great question! This is both the science and art of medicine. With respect to science, much of the medical literature are reports of how certain treatments work or don’t work. As doctors, we collate that information and make treatment recommendations based on the best science available. Medical science does change over time but as medical professionals, we strive to be as up to date as possible. And this pace of change is a good thing...we want our treatment options to get better and better over time. The art of medicine reflects what your doctor recommends for you while taking into account all the available options and your specific personal situation. The art of medicine also reflects how sometimes the right answer is unclear from science, and doctors then use their experience, expertise, and judgment to come up with the best solution for you.","doctors, decision, doctor",1,Treatment,"Neuro-Oncology Team, NeuroSurgery Team, Mental Health Team",,,,
Should I get a covid vaccine?,"Any treatment decision should of course be one you discuss with your personal physicians.That said, the Covid vaccines do not have any known downsides in patients with glioblastoma. In fact, the CDC recommends COVID vaccination for all adults with no restrictions based on any diseases you might also have. See their recommendations here.

I was told I have an inoperable tumor. What does that mean?,"Sometimes, tumors grow in regions of the brain where doing an operation would cause you significant harm. For example, surgery for glioblastoma in certain parts of the brain could cause irreversible problems with movement as an example. Your doctors want to remove as much of the tumor as possible but at the same time maintain your neurologic function. Surgical techniques like brain mapping can help in this regard.  If you hear that your tumor is inoperable, certainly ask why. If you’re unsatisfied with the answer, a second opinion may be worthwhile.","inoperable, biopsy, brain mapping, second opinion",2,Treatment,NeuroSurgery Team,,,,
What is proton beam therapy?,"Proton Beam Therapy is a highly precise form of radiation therapy that uses protons instead of photons. For most patients, proton beam therapy is not commonly used in glioblastoma. However, there is a lot of research being done to figure out if it should have more of a role.

What is KPS?,KPS stands for Karnofsky Performance Scale and goes from 0-100. It is essentially a measure of how functional you are. You may see your KPS score in your medical records. The KPS is one of many data points used to assess how you’re doing. It is also a data point used to help guide decision making in your care.

What is hydrocephalus?,"Hydrocephalus refers to increased pressure in the brain caused by too much fluid. Your brain has water tanks inside it which are called the ventricles. They are filled with a salty fluid called cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF). Your brain makes CSF continuously (almost 2 cups worth per day). The amount of CSF produced in 1 day is then also absorbed by the brain so the amount of CSF in your brain remains constant. Sometimes in patients with brain tumors, the CSF can build up and cause pressure and symptoms. The most common reason for hydrocephalus in patients with glioblastoma, is that the ability of the brain to absorb CSF is reduced. This is because sometimes factors floating around in the CSF caused by the tumor can clog up the ability of the brain to absorb the CSF. If you can imagine overflowing water near a clogged drainage pipe, that's similar to what is happening in hydrocephalus. Sometimes people refer to this condition as water on the brain. ","hydrocephalus, vocabulary, water on the brain, shunt, headaches, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, walking, confusion",3,"Diagnosis, Glossary","Neuro-Oncology Team, NeuroSurgery Team",,,,

What is “pressure on the brain?”,"Sometimes in medical reports or in DoctorSpeak, you may hear this phrase. Essentially, it means that there is compression of the brain by the tumor. Sometimes this pressure causes symptoms depending on the location of the tumor such as speech trouble, weakness or seizures. Other times no symptoms are present.  What to do about the pressure, if anything, is a discussion you’ll have with your doctors.","pressure on the brain, compression",2,"Diagnosis, Symptoms, Glossary","Neuro-Oncology Team, NeuroSurgery Team",,,,
What is gadolinium? Are there any side effects?,"Gadolinium is a chemical element (contrast agent) used routinely in brain MRIs and is very safe. It is an essential part of diagnosis and monitoring your tumor. Side effects are very rare but can be rarely seen in patients with pre-existing kidney issues. For that reason, you will be asked several questions prior to getting an MRI to make sure that gadolinium is safe for you to receive. If you’ve had a prior allergic reaction to gadolinium, you may still be able to receive gadolinium again if you receive steroids and benadryl beforehand.

",MRI,0.6,"Diagnosis, Surveillance, Glossary",Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,
I am claustrophobic. Are there any alternatives to MRI?,"Unfortunately, MRI remains the best test for your doctors to monitor your tumor. CT scans are much quicker than MRIs, but are much less sensitive at detecting small changes in your tumor. If you struggle to complete MRIs, talk to your doctor to see if anxiety-relieving medications (Ativan, Xanax) may be taken before an MRI to cause light sedation. If absolutely necessary, you can have general anesthesia for MRI scans but this is rarely required. Alternatively, some facilities have open MRI scanners, which are less claustrophobia-inducing than a standard MRI. However, the quality of open MRI scanners are generally not as good unfortunately.","MRI, claustrophobia",0.8,"Diagnosis, Surveillance, Symptoms","Neuro-Oncology Team, Patient & Caregiver Team, Mental Health Team",,,,
Are MRI’s dangerous?,"MRIs are safe to get for both diagnosis and surveillance(ie keeping an eye on your brain). There is no radiation associated with MRI scanners. You will often get a contrast agent called “gadolinium” which is safe and routinely used for patients with brain tumors. If there is any reason to limit gadolinium exposure (ie kidney problems or allergies), your doctor will discuss this with you. Certain types of metal implants (pacemakers, older tattoos) are also prohibited in the magnetic MRI environment. You will be asked many questions prior to getting an MRI to ensure that it is safe for you to receive.

 I’m pregnant. Can I have an MRI?,"Yes you can typically, though your doctor may choose to withhold the gadolinium. This needs to be discussed with your doctor. ","MRI, pregnant",1,"Diagnosis, Surveillance",Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,
Does an MRI deliver radiation to my body?,"No. CT (computed tomography) scans do deliver a small amount of radiation. However, MRI scans do not deliver any radiation. MRI scans acquire images based on the behavior of protons exposed to a very strong magnetic field. Magnetic fields are not dangerous to the human body. However, you cannot have any metal on your body when you enter an MRI scanner. Certain implanted devices (ie older pacemakers) cannot enter the MRI environment. Of note, the modern metal plates/screws that may have been placed from your brain surgery are safe in the MRI environment (they are made from titanium). Prior to an MRI you will be asked several questions to ensure an MRI is safe. If for some reason, an MRI cannot be obtained, then your doctor may order a CT scan which can still provide very useful information.","MRI, radiation",0.7,"Diagnosis, Surveillance",Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,

What are mutations? How are they related to cancer?,"A mutation is a change in the normal DNA sequence of a cell. In normally behaving cells, our genes regulate how often our cells divide to make new cells. In tumor cells, mutations cause changes in our genes that then cause our cells to divide uncontrollably. Our cells have a lot of guardrails to prevent this from happening but in cancer, many of these guardrails have been disabled by mutations. The typical mutations that cause glioblastoma arise from cells in the brain when you’re an adult, and are NOT passed down to your children. ","vocabulary, biology, mutations, genes",0.2,"Diagnosis, Precision Medicine",Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,
What is the difference between a surgical resection and a biopsy?,"A surgical resection and a biopsy are both neurosurgical procedures. In general a biopsy refers to a neurosurgical procedure where only a small piece of a tumor is removed for the purpose of making a diagnosis. A biopsy involves a small incision on the head so that a small needle can be introduced through the skull to sample (biopsy) the tumor tissue. A surgical resection generally refers to a procedure where the surgeon attempts to remove as much of the tumor as can be done safely (so called gross or near total resection). A surgical resection requires a larger incision and an opening in the skull called a craniotomy. Both neurosurgical procedures are done in the operating room under anesthesia typically, and require admission to the hospital for monitoring after the procedure.

I don’t have insurance or my insurance doesn't cover much. How do I get care? What is the ACA?,"Emergency care can be received through the emergency rooms at any hospital. However, it is important to do your best to get coverage. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has made this process easier(the ACA was a law passed by Congress to help expand insurance coverage in the United States). 
Each state has its own policies regarding emergency coverage so talk to a social worker or a hospital financial counselor in your hospital and they will help you understand your options. You can call 1-800-318-2596 to speak with someone about what type of coverage you might qualify for. It might also be helpful to visit https://triagecancer.org/cancer-resources-and-educational-information/quickguides#anchor-healthinsurance for all types of various quick guides on all things insurance, including accessing insurance as an immigrant, if moving out of state, or if you’ve lost coverage from an employer during treatment.

What questions should I ask my oncologist?,"You are going to form a long-term relationship with your oncologist and/or neuro-oncologist.  You don’t need to think of every question at the first visit. Information is often easiest to understand when you structure your thinking and questions and we provide some below. Your oncologist is both your doctor and coach, so it's important to build trust with him/her.

Some questions you may want to know about your oncologist and your care team: 
- How many patients like me do you treat in a year
- Do you work in a multi-disciplinary team?
- Does the whole team take my insurance?
- If I have questions how do I get in touch with the team?
- How often will I need to have doctors' appointments?
- Should I continue to see my general practitioner or primary care physician for check-ups and non-glioblastoma related issues?
- Does this hospital/treatment center/office have a patient portal, and how would or should I use that?
- I have heard that I may have frequent MRI scans. How will I get my results?
- On my patient portal I have access to many reports and results, what is your opinion about looking at those reports outside of our office visits together?
- Is it ok for me to bring a caregiver or other loved one with me to help take notes at appointments?
- Does this hospital/treatment center/office have a support group for my type of cancer?

Some questions you may ask about your diagnosis: 
- Can you explain what it means to have glioblastoma?
- What symptoms should I expect from the tumor?
- Will this affect my ability to work?
- Am I eligible for a clinical trial?
- What does my grade mean?
- Do we have genetic or genomic information about my cancer?
- Do we know how this cancer developed? 
- Will this cancer come back?
- Where can I learn more about the disease?

Some questions about treatment: 
- What is my treatment plan?
- What side effects (cognitive or physical) can I expect from treatment?
- What kind of symptoms do patients report when they undergo chemotherapy or radiation?
- Are there medications to manage side effects from these treatments?
- How does treatment affect my fertility? Should I freeze my sperm or eggs? 
- Are there clinical trials available for patients like me either here or nearby?
- How often will I get MRI scans to keep track of my disease?
- What kinds of things can I do to maximize quality of life and minimize symptoms? 

Some questions to ask about life: 
- Can I work?
- How will this diagnosis and treatment affect my work? My personal life?
- Can I exercise?
- Can I engage in sexual activity? 

You should have more than one opportunity to ask questions.  Sometimes this first visit can be very overwhelming and it may feel like you are being flooded with information.  Please don’t feel like you need to get every question answered all at once.  Process whatever information you can and be sure to ask your doctor how to best get in touch after you have a chance to think about things.

My doctor told me I need surgery. Why do I need surgery? Is it dangerous?,"Surgery is critical for the care of patients with brain tumors. The first reason is that surgery is the only way we can get a diagnosis to confirm the type of brain tumor you have. In the modern era, once the tumor is removed, it is analyzed both histologically(looking at the tumor tissue in a microscope) and genomically (profiling the genetics of the tumor to get a better understanding of its behavior). This information is then integrated to help guide you and your doctor with respect to prognosis and lets you know what type of individualized therapy options and clinical trials might be available for you.The next reason surgery is useful is because we know now that maximal removal of a tumor (gross total resection) is beneficial to your prognosis and care. Sometimes it can be too dangerous to remove the whole tumor and in these cases a small biopsy may be what your doctor recommends. This is an important discussion to have with your doctor. Finally, by relieving pressure on the brain, surgery can help improve many of the symptoms you may be experiencing. ","brain surgery, craniotomy, genomics, gross total resection, biopsy",0.2,"Diagnosis, Treatment, Clinical Trials",NeuroSurgery Team,,,,
Do I need to see an oncologist( or neuro-oncologist) before having surgery?,"Often, your neurosurgeon is the first doctor you’ll meet when you find out you have a brain tumor.  Oncologists and/or neuro-oncologists usually become involved once there is a diagnosis which comes from the surgery. If you wish to speak with an oncologist prior to surgery, that is certainly ok! However, it is unlikely they will prescribe any treatment plan until you have an operation to diagnose (biopsy) and hopefully remove the tumor. After the results from surgery have returned, they will work with your other providers in creating a customized treatment plan.","team, treatment, multi-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, oncologist, neuro-oncologist, chemotherapy, radiation",1,"Diagnosis, Treatment, Precision Medicine","Neuro-Oncology Team, NeuroSurgery Team",,,,
What can I expect after my diagnosis? What is my journey?,"Typically, you need surgery to diagnose (biopsy) and hopefully remove the majority of the tumor. Then you will recover and most likely undergo chemotherapy and radiation. After that is completed, you will continue chemotherapy and be monitored regularly with MRIs by your oncologist. This journey is not cast in stone though and may be modified based on your individual situation or in the context of a clinical trial. In general, this represents the current standard of care.

What is the treatment for hydrocephalus?,"Because hydrocephalus is caused by too much fluid in the brain, the treatment involves moving that fluid to a place where it can be absorbed safely. The most common method of treating hydrocephalus in patients with glioblastoma is called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP shunt). This involves making a small incision in the skull and placing a catheter (small silicone tube) into the ventricle. This tube is then connected to a small valve which regulates the amount of fluid that is leaving the brain. Finally, another tube is connected to the valve and tunneled under the skin where it enters the abdominal cavity using a small incision. This end of the catheter lives in the space where all your abdominal organs are located(like your stomach, intestines). The fluid can be absorbed safely in this space. The surgery itself is relatively quick and straightforward.","hydrocephalus, water on the brain, shunt, headaches, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, walking, confusion",3,"Diagnosis, Treatment",NeuroSurgery Team,,,,
 How do I choose my treatment team?,"There are many factors that go into choosing your doctors. Convenience cannot be overstated for you and your family. If there is a hospital or cancer center in your area with experience caring for patients with brain tumors, it is not necessary to fly all over the country to interview doctors from different hospitals.  

	What is most important is that you feel confident in your doctors, that you are able to have open and honest conversations, and that your doctors have the experience to provide you with all of the expertise you deserve. Like many things, experience and expertise matter. However, for your treatment team, it is wise to go to a place where there is extensive experience operating on brain tumors and taking care of patients before surgery, after surgery, and throughout treatment. 
	Though it can feel intimidating sometimes to ask your doctor about their credentials, they are all very used to being asked questions about how many patients they see and what kind of experience they have.  For example, you may ask your neurosurgeon how many of these surgeries they do in a year and what their outcomes are. It also means asking your oncologist and radiation oncologist how many patients like you they treat in a year. 

	Another point to consider is that radiation therapy will require treatments at the radiation suite Monday through Friday for up to 6 weeks, so choosing a radiation oncologist close to where you live will help cut down on travel. Some patients will choose to get most or all of their treatment close to home, but may ask for a second opinion at another brain tumor center. 

	At the end of the day, you want to feel comfortable with your team and have trust in their advice. ","team, treatment, multi-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, doctor, second opinion",0.1,"Diagnosis, Treatment","Neuro-Oncology Team, Social Work Team, Mental Health Team, Patient & Caregiver Team, NeuroSurgery Team",,,,
Why did I get a glioblastoma?,"You didn’t do anything to cause this tumor.  The overwhelming likelihood is that your glioblastoma grew due to some very unfortunate but random changes in the glial cells in your brain.  It is not your fault.  Generally, this is not a tumor that results from “exposures” like smoking. Glioblastoma happens when some cells in the brain get the wrong signal to divide and grow in an out-of-control pattern.  We don’t know why some brain cells get that signal.  That said, we are living in an unprecedented time when it comes to seeing advances on a daily basis for diseases like glioblastoma. Your team of doctors will work hard on your behalf along with an amazing community of doctors, patients, and caregivers to help you through this journey.

How is a glioblastoma diagnosed?,"Brain Tumors are typically diagnosed when patients present with symptoms like headaches or seizures. Sometimes patients can present with other symptoms like weakness or even personality changes. When these symptoms happen, a doctor may order a CT or MRI scan which may first identify the tumor.  A surgical procedure to either biopsy the tumor or remove the tumor is necessary to make the diagnosis.

What is a Primary Brain Tumor?,A primary brain tumor is one that grows from the brain itself. It did not spread from somewhere else in the body and is unlikely to travel outside of the brain. Glioblastoma is a primary brain tumor.,biology,1,"Intro to Glioblastoma, Glossary",Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,

What is an astrocyte? What is an oligodendroglial cell? What do they have to do with gliomas?,"Glial cells are cells in the brain that help support the neurons and hold them in place (they don’t directly produce electrical impulses in the brain like the nerves do). When a glial cell gains the ability to divide and grow out of control, it can create a tumor of glial cells, or a glioma. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are different types of glial cells and have distinctive functions. Classically, the cell of origin that divided and proliferated dictated the diagnosis. (A tumor composed of astrocytes would be an astrocytoma while a tumor composed of oligodendrocytes would cause an oligodendroglioma.) Nowadays, we rely more on the genetic markers in the tumor to help provide the diagnosis and a specific prognosis/treatment plan for you.

Is glioblastoma hereditary? Do my kids need to be screened?,"There is nothing you did to cause this diagnosis. In fact, glioblastoma is almost always a random occurrence. It is very unlikely that it was passed on to you or that you passed it on to your kids. Rarely patients have a hereditary tumor disease where they have glioblastoma in addition to other different tumors throughout the body. We do not generally recommend screening of children unless there are signs of a tumor syndrome (this is quite uncommon). If you have a strong family history of cancer or if you are concerned about your family risk, it can be helpful to talk to your doctor and to consider genetic counseling. 
			
There are rare circumstances where some families have had multiple members afflicted with the disease.

What is a glioblastoma?,"Glioblastomas are tumors that arise from glial cells which are the supporting cells of the brain that help neurons work. Glial cells provide a framework for all the neurons (without them our brains would just jelly). When these glial cells gain the ability to keep growing and dividing even when it’s crowded, a tumor (or glioma) can form. Unfortunately, no one knows exactly how these cells gain the ability to divide out of control, but we are learning more about them every day. Outside of exposure to ionizing radiation (such as when patients receive radiation treatment for another cancer or radiation exposure from nuclear sources), we do not know of definite environmental causes for these tumors.  ","risk factors, causes, biology, vocabulary",0.1,Intro to Glioblastoma,Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,
Is glioblastoma cancer?,"Although glioblastoma is unlikely to spread outside of the brain, it is considered a type of brain cancer. Cancer can mean several things, classically defined as when certain cells in the body grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body.

What stage is my cancer/What does it mean to be Grade 4?,"Unlike cancers in the body that are given a “stage” based on how far they have spread, glioblastoma is not staged but instead given a “grade” which refers to features found on review of the tissue sample from the tumor.  You may hear other people with cancer say that they have “stage 4 disease”, meaning that they have cancer that has spread to multiple organs in the body.  Glioblastoma is different from many other cancers because it generally does not spread outside of the brain.  Because of this, stage doesn’t really apply.  All glioblastomas are considered grade 4 brain tumors.  Grade 4 is a measure of how fast we think a brain tumor grows.  All glioblastomas are grade 4, no matter when they are found and no matter how large or small they might be when they are found.","biology, vocabulary, stage, grade",0.4,Intro to Glioblastoma,Neuro-Oncology Team,,,,
What is a mixed glioma?,"A mixed glioma can mean different things. Usually, it  refers to tumors that have multiple cell types within them when studying them under a microscope.

What is the difference between Rehab and a SNF?,"Each skilled nursing facility likely has several units that are dedicated to subacute rehab (SAR), which is short term rehabilitation intended to help you get strong enough to go to the next level of care. Subacute rehabilitation generally includes 1-2 hours of rehabilitation a day including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Length of stay at a SAR is generally a few weeks. Skilled nursing facilities also may have units dedicated to long term care, which is residential for individuals who may not be able to live elsewhere. Typically, the long term care within skilled nursing facilities is either private pay or covered by Medicaid, and not usually an included benefit of most medicare or commercial insurance plans.

Acute rehab is more intensive and shorter in length than subacute rehab. Acute rehab usually takes place within a specialized rehabilitation hospital, or on an acute rehab floor of an acute care hospital. As acute rehab programs typically require 3 hours a day of various therapies, In order to qualify a physiatrist needs to complete an evaluation while you are hospitalized and recommend that you will benefit from, and be able to tolerate the rigorous nature of acute rehab programs. Additionally, the insurance company may also need to review the documentation of the various providers in the hospital and authorize the rehab stay. ","SNF, social work, nursing, deficits, rehab",2,"Caregiver Resources, Treatment","Social Work Team, Patient & Caregiver Team",,,,

What is stress?  What happens with too much stress?,"One of the classic definitions of stress from Hans Selye (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915631/)  is “the non-specific response of the body to any demand for change”.  Stress is something we experience with any change, whether “good” or “bad”.  Stress activates our “flight, fight, or freeze response”.  That’s great if you’re faced with a bear, but isn’t the most hopeful thing to have activated all the time.  Chronic stress can really take a toll on your body.  While having glioblastoma is absolutely stressful and it’s easy for us to say “minimize your stress”, the reality is it’s hard.

"I’m having trouble sleeping, what can I do?","You’re not alone. Trouble sleeping is a common issue for those with glioblastoma.  The first thing to do is talk to your doctor.  It’s possible that you might be taking a medication, such as a steroid, that could be affecting your sleep.  The second thing is to make sure you are engaging in healthy sleep habits, otherwise known as sleep hygiene.  This includes:
1. Avoid caffeine 6-8 hours before bedtime
2. Use the bed only for sleep, sexual activity, or when feeling sick
3. Keep the sleep environment dark, quiet, cool, and comfortable
4. Minimize naps.  Only take if absolutely necessary and try to take them earlier in the day rather than too close to bedtime
5. Exercise, as allowed by your medical team
6. Create a bedtime routine, like brushing your teeth, doing some light stretches, and reading a book.
7. Try to wake up around the same time everyday

What are some non-medication ways I can deal with fatigue?,"Fatigue is the most common side effect of cancer and its treatment.  Exercise, as allowed by your medical team, can help with fatigue.  While this may be counterintuitive, many studies show that physical activity actually reduces fatigue in patients with cancer.  You might also ask your doctor about using a light box .  Also taking frequent breaks is important for managing fatigue.  Finally, adjusting your expectations and focusing on your priorities is important when dealing with fatigue. ",fatigue,1,"Symptoms, Mental Health and Support",,,,,
My doctor suggested I use pacing to manage fatigue. What is that?,"Pacing is the act of balancing rest with activity to help manage fatigue.  This means that you don’t overexert yourself while doing an activity. For example, instead of walking 20 minutes straight without breaks and getting so tired you can no longer walk for the rest of the day, you walk for 5 minutes and then take a break for 5 minutes, and so-on until you reach 20 minutes of walking.  Taking frequent breaks prevents you from overexerting yourself and potentially helps you to get more done in the day. ","fatigue, pacing",1,"Symptoms, Mental Health and Support",,,,,
How do I use a light box for fatigue?,"We definitely recommend talking to your doctor before you decide to use a light box, because it may not be recommended for you given certain side effects or contraindications.

What can I do?","Talking about death and end-of-life is really, really tough. But its important to have these hard conversations. And they don’t have to happen all at once. Sometimes, people need time and space to deal with these hard topics and thats ok. If your loved one struggles to have these conversations, you may consider talking to a couples/family therapist to help you navigate these conversations.

I'm interested in an emotional support animal(ESA). How do I get one?,"An emotional support animal is a dog or other animal that provides comfort and companionship for someone dealing with mental illness. In order to get an emotional support animal, you need a mental health professional to write you a letter certifying that you have a disabling mental illness and that the animal supports your mental health.  Please make sure you are getting a letter from someone trained and authorized to do so. However, keep in mind ESAs do not have the same rights as service dogs, because they are not trained to perform specific tasks related to the individual’s disability.  Airlines also are no longer required to accept ESAs, and it is up to each airline to decide how they want to handle ESAs. However, the federal Fair Housing Act does require that landlords must make “reasonable accommodations” for ESAs.","emotional support animal, ESA",2,Mental Health and Support,Mental Health Team,,,,
"I’m struggling with making a behavior change (e.g., walking more frequently, or meditating more) that I’d really like to make? What can I do to increase the likelihood of me doing these things?","Making behavior changes are hard.  You might consider
1. Make a SMART plan to help you achieve your goals  
2. Add it to your calendar or leave notes
3. Link it with another activity that you do already.  For example, if your goal is to walk more, you may schedule going for a walk after you finish breakfast
4. Hold yourself accountable. For example, Find an accountability buddy-someone you can do the activity with or someone who checks in on you and supports you

I’m embarrassed or anxious to leave my house because I don’t look or act like I used to. How do I deal with this?,"These feelings are normal, in part because your body has changed.  However, isolating oneself and not getting out can be detrimental to one’s mental health.  Take small steps getting out there and test your limits of comfortability.  You may find that the activities you try are actually quite enjoyable; this will give you the confidence to do even more. ",anxiety,2,"Mental Health and Support, Symptoms",Mental Health Team,,,,

https://www.cancer.gov/rare-brain-spine-tumor/living/symptoms/difficulty-walking

From their website: 
- Take precautions to avoid falls.
    - When standing, go slow and hold onto something.
    - Be careful on the stairs and always use handrails. 
    - Install non-skid surfaces in the bath and other slippery spots in your home. 
    - Remove throw rugs and mats, and clear walkways of extra furniture.
    - Make sure your room is well lit so you can see where your feet are. 
- Talk to your health care provider about if assistive devices, including canes and walkers, may be needed to improve your balance or support areas of weakness. 
- A referral to a physical or occupational therapist may be helpful to assess what assistive devices would be helpful, plan exercises, and learn how to move around safely.
- Wear well-fitting shoes. Orthopedic shoes or gel sole inserts may help lessen discomfort while walking. 
- A home safety evaluation can be ordered by your health care professional to evaluate your home. They will make suggestions for any modifications that are needed to maintain your safety.
